       <p> Originally conceived for the college’s students by the Management Society of TSEC (MS-TSEC) as an introduction to the rich world of debate, Speaktacular rapidly grew from its humble beginnings in 2010 to the national competition it is today under the guidance of the Society’s counsellor, Ms. Anjali Malviya. and TSEC’s principal, Dr. G. T. Thampi.</p>

<p>2014 saw an exemplary discussion on controversial subjects, with teams from around the nation bending and twisting the opinions of packed halls to polarise each mind to their favour. The rigorous screening procedure followed in selecting candidates ensured a competitive and fruitful discussion without a dull moment as the audience roared with laughter at the wit on display and was hushed into silence at flawless logic and passionate arguments as a diverse range of students across various fields of study, from law to engineering, went head-to-head over a carefully chosen series of topics designed to challenge the sharpest minds and tread the grey area between right and wrong, the ultimate judge, as always, being those in attendance.</p>
